      - content: 'Micronutrients such as: folic acid, iron, iodine, selenium, zinc, and vitamins A, Bs, C, D, E, K are essential
  for human health and are mostly acquired from the food we eat. Although humans require small quantities of these
  micronutrients, inadequate intake of one or more of these cause micronutrient deficiency (MND) which have
  serious ramifications on the health of individuals affected and the economy of the country in which they live.
  Micronutrient deficiencies are global problems and can be significant concerns in sub-Saharan Africa. With the
  burgeoning human population and anticipated changes in climate which impact on food availability, MNDs are
  likely to remain important problems. Hence, it is crucial to better understand MNDs at various scales and
  time-horizons, to support evidence gathering for policy interventions and program investments.'
  - title: The Micronutrient Support Tool

      - content: 'Micronutrient Action Policy Support (MAPS) tool will deliver a co-designed, web-hosted tool, to enable the best
  possible estimates of MNDs to be communicated at national and sub-national scales in Africa. The MAPS tool
  will be a unique enabling environment for the wider Agriculture-Nutrition community and beyond. Through novel
  functionality, this tool will allow users to view and explore MND risks at various spatial and temporal scales.
  The tool will provide users with dietary micronutrient supply estimates of all nations in Africa using
  national-scale data, which can be spatially disaggregated by population data. Where survey data on food
  consumption (e.g. Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys, HCES) or food composition (e.g. GeoNutrition
  surveys) are available for a nation, these data will support delivery of sub-national estimates of dietary
  micronutrient supplies and risks of deficiency. Where both types of data are available with good spatial
  resolution for the geography of interest, these will provide the most spatially disaggregated estimates
  possible.'
