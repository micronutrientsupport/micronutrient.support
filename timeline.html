                <p>A web-delivered tool to estimate micronutrient deficiencies and explore pathways to improve
                    nutrition.
                    This will have associated user-support and educational resources. The tool will be fully open
                    access,
                    with pre-loaded and bring-your-own data options. Is any of this functionality of interest to you?
                    Please
                    connect with us if so by emailing <a href="mailto:codesign@micronutrient.support">codesign@micronutrient.support</a> and we will keep you updated.

                <h2 class="text-primary">What is happening right now?</h2>
                <p>We are busy confirming our data and modelling protocols for the MAPS Tool cost and effectiveness functionality. 
                    We are continuing to engage with potential users to ensure that we prioritise functionality development that 
                    will make the tool easy to use and well-designed for the users’ needs.</p>

                <p></p>We are also now developing our user-support and educational/training resources, due for initial testing 
                and use in the second half of 2022.</p>
                <p>Want to get involved? Please contact us at <a href="mailto:codesign@micronutrient.support">codesign@micronutrient.support</a> or see <a href="/co-design/">co-design</a> for more details.

                <p>We have started small-scale user-testing of the system, with early ‘live’ version release due in the first quarter of 2022, with incremental build-up of released functionality throughout 2022
                     and into early 2023. Want to get involved in this system testing? Please contact
