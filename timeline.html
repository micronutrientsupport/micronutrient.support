                <p>A web-delivered tool to estimate micronutrient deficiencies and explore pathways to improve
                    nutrition.
                    This will have associated user-support and educational resources. The tool will be fully open
                    access,
                    with pre-loaded and bring-your-own data options. Is any of this functionality of interest to you?
                    Please
                    connect with us if so by emailing <a href="mailto:codesign@micronutrient.support">codesign@micronutrient.support</a> and we will keep you updated.

                <p>We are busy confirming our data and modelling protocols for the MAPS Tool. We are also conducting
                    short user interviews to ensure that we prioritise functionality development that will make the tool
                    easy to use and well-designed for the questions users have. Want to get involved? Please contact us at <a href="mailto:codesign@micronutrient.support">codesign@micronutrient.support</a> or see <a href="/co-design/">co-design</a> for more details.

                <p>From late 2020 we will start user-testing of the system, progressing through from wireframes to early
                    ‘live’ version releases later in 2021. Want to get involved in this system testing? Please contact
